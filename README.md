# OnTour: Concert History Tracker

OnTour is an interactive app that lets users document and track their concert history. This repository is a project created at the coding bootcamp Launch Academy as a way to showcase my skills with a variety of web development technologies.

Check out my site at www.concertsontour.com

# Technologies

I used a Rails backend and React.js coupled with React Router 4 for the frontend functionality. This allows a page to update dynamically when a user adds a new concert or views their concert show page or profile.

My test suite incorporates RSpec for Rails model tests, Capybara and RSpec for Rails acceptance tests, and Jasmine/Enzyme for React components.

User authentication is handled by the Google Omniauth integration and user data is persisted to a PostgreSQL database.

# Setup

After cloning down the repo

Why did we use webpacker and what does it do?????
